                <p>This site is a living experiment to stay up to date on front-end development.  While only scratching the surface of the mythical <a href="https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap">full-stack</a>, the starting point was <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp">Colt Steele's Web Development Bootcamp</a>. The course was a well-guided tour of modern front-end and back-end technologies including HTML, CSS, Javascript, <a href="https://nodejs.org">Node.js</a>, <a href="https://expressjs.com">Express</a>, <a href="https://www.mongodb.com">MongoDB</a>, authentication, ReSTful API's, continuous deployment techniques and a healthy spattering of contemporary web design resources including <a href="https://jquery.com">jQuery</a>, <a href="https://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap's CSS and JS frameworks</a>, <a href="http://unsplash.com">unsplash.com's</a> stunning collection of creative commons photography and the ever-so-useful <a href="http://fontawesome.io">fontawesome.io</a>. These amazing tools and frameworks make quickly designing modern, mobile-friendly sites as fun as playing with Legos.</p>

                <p>"DeadlySyn" is a play on the (in)famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_deadly_sins">seven deadly sins</a> which were lust, gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, envy and pride.  Each were bad in their own way, but it only took one to endanger your mortal soul!</p>
                <p>Similarly, as we've become used to hearing on the nightly news, a single mis-placed packet can exploit zero-day vulnerabilities and slip through backdoors to endanger sensitive customer data or bring down critical infrastructure.</p>
                <p>Building micro-services and APIs which, by design, expose surface area to user populations of varied intent requires we be ever vigilant!</p>
